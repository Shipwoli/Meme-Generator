# Code Structure
The code for the frontend is organized into several directories and files:

src/App.js: The main component that handles the routing of the application.
src/components: Contains the various components used in the application, such as Login, Register, Header, and AddMeme.
src/utils: Contains utility functions used in the application, such as the PrivateRoute component for handling user authentication.

# Future Improvements
Some possible future improvements to the application include:

* Implementing user roles to restrict certain actions to certain users (e.g. only allowing the creator of a meme to update or delete it).
* Adding image upload functionality so that users can upload images from their devices instead of having to provide image URLs.
* Improving the search functionality to allow for more advanced search options, such as searching by tags or categories.
